# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This version was modified by Matt Newton to work with MySQL as a
backend instead of SQLite.  This required following instructions here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1670154/convert-a-ruby-on-rails-app-from-sqlite-to-mysql,
and running the following command to install Ubuntu 11.10 prereqs:

sudo apt-get install mysql-admin mysql-navigator nodejs libmysqlclient16-dev
